# Employee-Tracker

## About the Project
With the Employee Tracker, you can quickly create and access important information about your team members by using a command-line application. The command line will run you through a set of prompts that will require user input. You have the option to view all departments, roles, and employees. You will also have the option to add a department, role, and employee, as well as update an already existing employee. Once the prompts are completed the user may choose to view the departments, roles, or employees, and a table displaying the newly stored data will become availabe. The user may exit the program at any time by selecting "exit".
